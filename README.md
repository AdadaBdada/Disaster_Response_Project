# Disaster Response Pipeline Project

### Description

This Project is to build a Natural Language Processing tool analyze disaster data from Figure Eight to build a model for an API that classifies disaster messages.

The Project is divided in the following Sections:

1. Data Processing, ETL Pipeline to extract data from source, clean data and save them in a proper databse structure
2. Machine Learning Pipeline to train a model able to classify text message in categories
3. Web App to show model results in real time.

### File Structure

### Dependencies
* Python 3.5+
* Machine Learning Libraries: NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, Sciki-Learn
* Natural Language Process Libraries: NLTK
* SQLlite Database Libraqries: SQLalchemy
* Web App and Data Visualization: Flask, Plotly


### Instructions:
1. Run the following commands in the project's root directory to set up your database and model.

    - To run ETL pipeline that cleans data and stores in database
        `python data/process_data.py data/disaster_messages.csv data/disaster_categories.csv data/DisasterResponse.db`
    - To run ML pipeline that trains classifier and saves
        `python models/train_classifier.py data/DisasterResponse.db models/classifier.pkl`

2. Run the following command in the app's directory to run your web app.
    `python run.py`

3. Go to http://0.0.0.0:3001/
